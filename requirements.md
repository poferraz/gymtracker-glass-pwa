---

#### FR-7: Progress Tracking & Statistics
**Description**: Users can visualize workout progress over time.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Charts showing workout frequency
- Exercise progression graphs (weight over time)
- Personal records tracking
- Streak counters and milestones

---

#### FR-8: Workout Programs/Routines
**Description**: Users can create and follow pre-planned workout routines.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create named routines with exercise sequences
- Start session from routine template
- Track routine completion
- Suggest next workout from program

---

### LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)

#### FR-9: Rest Timer
**Description**: Built-in countdown timer for rest periods between sets.

---
